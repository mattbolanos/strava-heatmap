# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 28, 2025**

## Overview

Stratiles is an iOS app that displays your Strava activity data as a heatmap widget on your Home Screen. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data we access, how it is used, and your rights.

## Data We Access

When you connect your Strava account, Stratiles reads the following via the Strava API:

- Activity dates
- Activity types (run, ride, swim, etc.)
- Activity distances

We request the activity:read_all scope from Strava. No other data (heart rate, GPS routes, personal profile details) is accessed.

## Data Storage

All activity data is stored locally on your device. It is never sent to, stored on, or processed by any external server. There is no user account, no cloud sync, and no analytics.

## Authentication

Strava OAuth tokens are exchanged through a lightweight proxy server. This proxy injects the Strava API credentials and forwards requests to Strava. It does not log, store, or inspect any data passing through it.

## Tracking & Analytics

Stratiles does not include any analytics SDKs, advertising frameworks, or tracking pixels. We do not collect usage data of any kind.

## Third-Party Services

The only third-party service Stratiles communicates with is the Strava API. Your use of Strava is governed by Strava's Privacy Policy.

## Deleting Your Data

To remove all data stored by Stratiles:

- Sign out within the app (Settings → Sign Out)
- Delete the app from your device

To revoke Stratiles' access to your Strava account, visit Strava → Settings → My Apps and remove Stratiles.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted with a new "Last updated" date.
